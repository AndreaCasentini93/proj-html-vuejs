                                As a coach and menthor, my ultimate goal is to motivate visual artists toward inspirated action. I help you get you back on track to being the productive, creative, meaningful and authentic artist you truly want to be. I support artists in crafting and living a creative life as well as feeling good about themselves and their art.

                                As an artist and an educator for early 30 years, I understand what it takes to create.
